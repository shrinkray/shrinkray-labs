## SOSS DOOR HARDWARE

## Synopsis

Universal Industrial, Inc. is the original patent holder and manufacturer of Soss premium door hardware, including Invisible Hinge and the Ultralatch door handle products. My role involved all aspects for the WordPress sites. I proposed designs, built front and backend interfaces for several websites for the small US owned manufacturer. For over five years I  guided two site redesigns, oversaw migration, hosting, security, payment processing, and implemented several marketing feature customizations such as implementing Babylon JS 3DS and GSAP  animations.

### Key Achievements

- Developed architecture and design of intuitive user experiences across mobile-ready, themed websites.
- Improve client satisfaction through website security, effective troubleshooting support, and implementing consistent themes and interactions, coding web-delivered products.
- Guided acceptance of  Stripe payment processing
