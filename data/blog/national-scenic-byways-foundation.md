## NATIONAL SCENIC BYWAYS FOUNDATION

## Synopsis

The NSBF is a non-profit providing tourism information to travel bureaus. NSBF received a grant from Toyota to make specific destination information accessible from state pages but the work needed to be completed fast. I implemented the solution using Laravel Mix with Webpack plus the latest Tailwind CSS configuration producing tiny files. Utilizing accessibility linting tools conducted tests for the project site and deployed an improved code structure.

### Key Achievements

- Developed architecture and design of intuitive user experiences across mobile-ready, themed websites.
- Improve client satisfaction through website security, effective troubleshooting support, and implementing consistent themes and interactions, coding web-delivered products.
- Guided acceptance of  Stripe payment processing
